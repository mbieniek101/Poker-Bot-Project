# CSE368: Intro to AI Final Project

### Note: We are using the library [treys](https://github.com/ihendley/treys/tree/master) for the poker cards

Using different libraries and AI concepts, we are working towards creating a GUI that allows a player to play Texas Holdem' against a Poker bot trained on statistical data to make strategic game theory-based decisions to optimize play.

# PROGRESS

We are at the midway point, where we created the gameplay and a rudimentary GUI. We are continuing to improve the GUI and are beginning to investigate AI and game theory libraries to use for training and optimizing our bot's logic.
